## Description

Our main goal for the development of this application was to create a site for young adults and teens to learn about astronomy in a new, cool, and fun way. This problem alleviates the boredom that results in learning astronomy!

To accomplish this, we used NASA's API to display the daily astornomy photo and the Rick and Morty API to display which character's DNA has been discovered at this specific location in space. 
The NASA API lists the current date, the person who discovered this area in space, all relative NASA documented information about it, and its official title. 
The Rick and Morty API lists the displayed character's name, gender, location, origin, species, and status.

During this development process, our team learned how to incorporate efficient and innovative teamwork and the utilization of GitHub (we are GitHub professionals now). We actively worked together and communicated to generate the application, create the entire code, troubleshoot, and resolve bugs.

## Usage

The button labeled "Developers" will show all the developers that contribute to this application.
The "Click ME!" button will jump you straight to the Rick and Morty DNA section.
The Pickle Rick button at the bottom will refresh the Rick and Morty API, and locally store how many times the button is pressed.

The astronomy photo will only change when the date changes, but the button at the bottom will call the Rick and Morty API every time you click it to display more characters with found specimen at the respective location.
